I am a fourth-year PhD student at the [Artificial Intelligence Department, RUC](http://ai.ruc.edu.cn/).
I am advised by Prof. [Zihe Wang](https://gsai.ruc.edu.cn/wangzihe).
Previously, I was an undergraduate student in computer science at [Central South University](https://cse.csu.edu.cn/).

I am interested in EconCS and Multi-Agent System. 
My current research focuses on **information design**, with particular emphasis on competitive information design games.
