I am a third-year PhD student at the [Artificial Intelligence Department, RUC](http://ai.ruc.edu.cn/).
I am advised by Professor [Zihe Wang](https://gsai.ruc.edu.cn/wangzihe).
Previously, I was an undergraduate student in computer science and technology at [Central South University](https://cse.csu.edu.cn/).

I am interested in EconCS and Multi-Agent System. 
My current research focuses on information design, with particular emphasis on equilibrium characterization in competitive information design games.

[**News!**] Starting from this September, I will visit Professor [Yingkai Li](https://yingkai-li.github.io/) at NUS for six months. 
Feel free to reach me out if you're in Singapore.
